  The Blinkdemo on arduino nanos are a good start to learn how to code. 
  The next step was to upgrade the Arduino's blinking demo to a (scientific) cool display demo. With only one LED and no additional components.
  The tens of the temperature are displayed as a long flashing pulse. The ones short impulses.
  Example: 23 degree Celsius: Two long pulses and 3 short pulses.
